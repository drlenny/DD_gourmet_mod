	[h1]Overview[/h1]
	[h2]----------------------------------------------------[/h2]
	[i]&quot;A refined taste elevates us from the beasts. Hunger drags us down beneath them.&quot;[/i]

	An unlikely individual has trotted its way into town and made itself at home within the tavern&apos;s kitchen. While its monstrous visage and mannerisms have made the locals more than uneasy, it has not yet shown to be overtly hostile, and what&apos;s more it has proven to be an astonishingly skilled chef. The townsfolk have decided to let sleeping dogs lie as it were and allow for the continued existence of this pig man so long as it remains well behaved and provides more delicious meals. You may even be able to turn the beast&apos;s innate ferocity onto the more looming threats the Hamlet faces with enough persuasion... and treats.

	The Gourmet is a front-line behemoth that can dish out as much punishment as it receives. Equipped with debilitating attacks that weaken foes, he can set up big payoffs for either himself or his allies to capitalize on. He is able to fulfill the role of a tanky support protecting the team from harm or as a potent finisher with heavy blows.

	While on a team during expiditions, the Gourmet puts its culinary skills to work both on and off the battlefield. You may discover that they have created a well prepared meal made from ingredients in the local environment. Those who are willing to partake in these treats may find themselves bolstered for the coming battles. Be wary however, for a swine&apos;s diet may not be agreeable with others, especially for one as gastronomicaly adventurous as this...

	You have a chance of finding unique food items after a battle or by using the &apos;Leftovers&apos; camping skill. There are two unique items to each region along with two additional generic items that can be found. Each one provides different benefits such as buffs, heals, and resistances but they also come with a cost to said conditions. 
	
	The in game descriptions are intentionally vague hinting at what you can possibly expect to invite some risk and discovery. For those wishing to have a detailed explanation of the effects in order to strategize, a document going over all of the items and their associated effects can be found in the following link.
